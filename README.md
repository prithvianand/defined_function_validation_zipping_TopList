Questions
"""
1. There are two lists of different lengths. The first contains keys, and the second contains values.
Write a function that creates a dictionary from these keys and values.
If the key did not have enough values, the dictionary should have the value None.
Values that did not have enough keys should be ignored.
Write a test using unittest/pytest.

2. There is a restriction in the authorization system:
    * the password must begin with a latin letter,

    * the password must end only with a latin letter or number;
    * minimum password length is one character
    * maximum password length is 20 characters
